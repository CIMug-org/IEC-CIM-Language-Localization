# IEC-CIM-Language-Localization
IEC-CIM language Localisation

This repo contains ontology files that only contain rdfs:Labels in languages other than English

This repo will be used to render the IEC-CIM ontology at cim.puffinsemantics.com. Right now this is our pet project but we hope to hand this project over to the CIM community if sufficient interest is shown. Please see https://www.puffinsemantics.com/documentation/ontologylocalization/ for an intruction  on how you can create your own language localization file.
